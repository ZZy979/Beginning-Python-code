[Python-announce] PyCA cryptography 42.0.7 released
---------------------------------------------------
PyCA cryptography 42.0.7 has been released to PyPI. cryptography
includes both high level recipes and low level interfaces to common
cryptographic algorithms such as symmetric ciphers, asymmetric
algorithms, message digests, X.509, key derivation functions, and much
more. We support Python 3.7+, and PyPy3 7.3.10+.

Changelog (https://cryptography.io/en/latest/changelog/#v42-0-7):
* Restored Windows 7 compatibility for our pre-built wheels. Note that
we do not test on Windows 7 and wheels for our next release will not
support it. Microsoft no longer provides support for Windows 7 and
users are encouraged to upgrade.

- Paul Kehrer (reaperhulk)


[Python-announce] [RELEASE] Python 3.13.0 beta 1 released
---------------------------------------------------------
After a little bit of excitement discovering new bugs during the release, *itâs
done*: 3.13.0 beta 1 is released, the 3.13 branch has been created, and
features for 3.13 are frozen! The main branch is now 3.14.0a0.
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130b1/

*This is a beta preview of Python 3.13*

Python 3.13 is still in development. This release, 3.13.0b1, is the first
of four beta release previews of 3.13.

Beta release previews are intended to give the wider community the
opportunity to test new features and bug fixes and to prepare their
projects to support the new feature release.

We *strongly encourage* maintainers of third-party Python projects to *test
with 3.13* during the beta phase and report issues found to the Python bug
tracker <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues> as soon as possible.
While the release is planned to be feature complete entering the beta
phase, it is possible that features may be modified or, in rare cases,
deleted up until the start of the release candidate phase (Tuesday
2024-07-30). Our goal is to have no ABI changes after beta 4 and as few
code changes as possible after 3.13.0rc1, the first release candidate. To
achieve that, it will be *extremely important* to get as much exposure for
3.13 as possible during the beta phase.

Please keep in mind that this is a preview release and its use is *not*
recommended for production environments.

new features of the 3.13 series, compared to 3.12

Some of the new major new features and changes in Python 3.13 are:
<https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-13-0b1-now-available/52891#new-features-2>New
features

   - A new and improved interactive interpreter
   <https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#a-better-interactive-interpreter>,
   based on PyPy <https://pypy.org>âs, featuring multi-line editing and
   color support, as well as colorized exception tracebacks
   <https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#improved-error-messages>
   .
   - An *experimental* free-threaded build mode
   <https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#free-threaded-cpython>,
   which disables the Global Interpreter Lock, allowing threads to run more
   concurrently.
   - A preliminary, *experimental* JIT
   <https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#experimental-jit-compiler>,
   providing the ground work for significant performance improvements.
   - The (cyclic) garbage collector is now incremental
   <https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#incremental-garbage-collection>,
   which should mean shorter pauses for collection in programs with a lot of
   objects.
   - A modified version of mimalloc <https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc>
   is now included, optional but enabled by default if supported by the
   platform, and required for the free-threaded build mode.
   - Docstrings now have their leading indentation stripped
   <https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#other-language-changes>,
   reducing memory use and the size of .pyc files. (Most tools handling
   docstrings already strip leading indentation.)
   - The dbm module <https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/dbm.html> has a
   new dbm.sqlite3 backend
   <https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#dbm> that is used by
   default when creating new files.

<https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-13-0b1-now-available/52891#typing-3>
Typing

   - Support for type defaults in type parameters

and new deprecations

   - PEP 594 (Removing dead batteries from the standard library)
   <https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/> scheduled removals of many
   deprecated modules: aifc, audioop, chunk, cgi, cgitb, crypt, imghdr,
   mailcap, msilib, nis, nntplib, ossaudiodev, pipes, sndhdr, spwd, sunau,
   telnetlib, uu, xdrlib, lib2to3.
   - Many other removals
   <https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#removed> of deprecated
   classes, functions and methods in various standard library modules.
   - C API removals <https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#id10>
   and deprecations <https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#id9>.
   (Some removals present in alpha 1 were reverted in alpha 2, as the removals
   were deemed too disruptive at this time.)
   - New deprecations
   <https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#deprecated>, most of
   which are scheduled for removal from Python 3.15 or 3.16.

(Hey, *fellow core developer,* if a feature you find important is missing
from this list, let Thomas know <thomas@python.org>.)

result of 11 months of development since the last feature release and is
the work of 198 contributors spread over 1041 pull requests. It contains a
large number of exciting new features as well as changes to both the Python
and C APIs.

This major release includes breaking changes that could not happen in a
regular minor (feature) release - including an ABI break, changes to type
promotion rules, and API changes which may not have been emitting
deprecation warnings in 1.26.x. Key documents related to how to adapt to
changes in NumPy 2.0 include:

   - The release notes on Github
   <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases/tag/v2.0.0rc1>
   - The numpy-2-migration-guide
   <https://numpy.org/devdocs/numpy_2_0_migration_guide.html>
   - The numpy 2.0-specific advice in for downstream package authors
   <https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/depending_on_numpy.html>

Highlights include:

   - A new variable-length string dtype, StringDType, and a new
   `numpy.strings` namespace with performant ufuncs for string operations.
   - Support for float32 and long double in all `numpy.fft` functions.
   - Support for the array API standard in the main numpy namespace.
   - MacOS Accelerate support and binary wheels for macOS >=14.
   - A new tracing and introspection API.
   - Performance improvements.
   - Python API improvements.
   - C API improvements.

This release supports Python 3.9-3.12. Wheels can be downloaded from PyPI
<https://pypi.org/project/numpy/2.0.0rc2>; source archives, release notes,
and wheel hashes are available on Github
<https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases/tag/v2.0.0rc2>.

[Python-announce] [RELEASE] Python 3.13.0 beta 2 released.
----------------------------------------------------------
After a little bit of a delay (I blame the flat tire on my rental car),
3.13.0b2 is released:
 https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130b2/
<https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130b2/>

<https://discuss.python.org/t/3-13-0b2-now-available/55056#this-is-a-beta-preview-of-python-313-1>This
is a beta preview of Python 3.13

Python 3.13 is still in development. This release, 3.13.0b2, is the second
of four beta release previews of 3.13.

Beta release previews are intended to give the wider community the
opportunity to test new features and bug fixes and to prepare their
projects to support the new feature release.

We *strongly encourage* maintainers of third-party Python projects to *test
with 3.13* during the beta phase and report issues found to the Python bug
tracker <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues> as soon as possible.
While the release is planned to be feature complete entering the beta
phase, it is possible that features may be modified or, in rare cases,
deleted up until the start of the release candidate phase (Tuesday
2024-07-30). Our goal is to have no ABI changes after beta 4 and as few
code changes as possible after 3.13.0rc1, the first release candidate. To
achieve that, it will be *extremely important* to get as much exposure for
3.13 as possible during the beta phase.

*Two particularly noteworthy changes in beta 2 involve the macOS installer
we provide:*

   - The minimum supported macOS version was changed from 10.9 to *10.13
   (High Sierra)*. Older macOS versions will not be supported going forward.
   - The macOS installer package now includes an optional additional build
   of Python 3.13 with the experimental free-threading feature enabled. The
   free-threaded version, python3.13t, is separate from and co-exists with the
   traditional GIL-only installation. The free-threaded build is not installed
   by default; use the Customize option of the installer as explained in the
   installer readme. Since this is an experimental feature, there may be
   late-breaking issues found; see the free-threaded macOS build issue
   <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/120098> on GitHub for the most
   recent status.

Please keep in mind that this is a preview release and its use is *not*
recommended for production environments.

   - PEP 594 (Removing dead batteries from the standard library)
   <https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/> scheduled removals of many
   deprecated modules: aifc, audioop, chunk, cgi, cgitb, crypt, imghdr,
   mailcap, msilib, nis, nntplib, ossaudiodev, pipes, sndhdr, spwd, sunau,
   telnetlib, uu, xdrlib, lib2to3.
   - Many other removals
   <https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#removed> of deprecated
   classes, functions and methods in various standard library modules.
   - C API removals <https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#id10>
   and deprecations <https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#id9>.
   (Some removals present in alpha 1 were reverted in alpha 2, as the removals
   were deemed too disruptive at this time.)
   - New deprecations
   <https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#deprecated>, most of
   which are scheduled for removal from Python 3.15 or 3.16.

(Hey, *fellow core developer,* if a feature you find important is missing
from this list, let Thomas know <thomas@python.org>.)

and documentation changes since 3.12.3.
<https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-12-4-now-available/55128#major-new-features-of-the-312-series-compared-to-311-2>Major
new features of the 3.12 series, compared to 3.11
<https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-12-4-now-available/55128#new-features-3>New
features

   - More flexible f-string parsing
   <https://docs.python.org/3.12/whatsnew/3.12.html#pep-701-syntactic-formalization-of-f-strings>,
   allowing many things previously disallowed (PEP 701
   <https://peps.python.org/pep-0701/>).
   - Support for the buffer protocol
   <https://docs.python.org/3.12/whatsnew/3.12.html#pep-688-making-the-buffer-protocol-accessible-in-python>
   in Python code (PEP 688 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0688/>).
   - A new debugging/profiling API
   <https://docs.python.org/3.12/whatsnew/3.12.html#pep-669-low-impact-monitoring-for-cpython>
   (PEP 669 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0669/>).
   - Support for isolated subinterpreters
   <https://docs.python.org/3.12/whatsnew/3.12.html#pep-684-a-per-interpreter-gil>
   with separate Global Interpreter Locks (PEP 684
   <https://peps.python.org/pep-0684>).
   - Even more improved error messages
   <https://docs.python.org/3.12/whatsnew/3.12.html#improved-error-messages>.
   More exceptions potentially caused by typos now make suggestions to the
   user.
   - Support for the Linux perf profiler
   <https://docs.python.org/3.12/howto/perf_profiling.html> to report
   Python function names in traces.
   - Many large and small performance improvements
   <https://docs.python.org/3.12/whatsnew/3.12.html#optimizations> (like PEP
   709 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0709/> and support for the BOLT binary
   optimizer), delivering an estimated 5% overall performance improvement.

<https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-12-4-now-available/55128#type-annotations-4>Type
annotations

   - New type annotation syntax
   <https://docs.python.org/3.12/whatsnew/3.12.html#pep-695-type-parameter-syntax>
   for generic classes (PEP 695 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/>).
   - New override decorator
   <https://docs.python.org/3.12/whatsnew/3.12.html#pep-698-override-decorator-for-static-typing>
   for methods (PEP 698 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0698>).

<https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-12-4-now-available/55128#deprecations-5>
Deprecations

   - The deprecated wstr and wstr_length members of the C implementation of
   unicode objects were removed, per PEP 623
   <https://peps.python.org/pep-0623/>.
   - In the unittest module, a number of long deprecated methods and
   classes were removed. (They had been deprecated since Python 3.1 or 3.2).
   - The deprecated smtpd and distutils modules have been removed (see PEP
   594 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/> and PEP 632
   <https://peps.python.org/pep-0632/>. The setuptools package continues to
   provide the distutils module.
   - A number of other old, broken and deprecated functions, classes and
   methods <https://docs.python.org/3.12/whatsnew/3.12.html#removed> have
   been removed.
   - Invalid backslash escape sequences in strings now warn with
   SyntaxWarning instead of DeprecationWarning, making them more visible.
   (They will become syntax errors in the future.)
   - The internal representation of integers has changed in preparation for
   performance enhancements. (This should not affect most users as it is an
   internal detail, but it may cause problems for Cython-generated code.)
